# Chest-X-Ray-Detection
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Chest X-Ray Detection, a powerful diagnostic tool developed from a dissertation project titled "COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-Ray Images using Explainable Boosting Algorithms". The dissertation addresses the urgent need for transparency in AI-powered diagnostic models. Combining the robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the strength of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the interpretability of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Chest X-Ray Detection delivers accurate and explainable COVID-19 predictions from chest X-ray images. Achieving an accuracy of 91.61% and an F1 score of 91.39%, this tool is designed to support healthcare professionals in the fight against the pandemic.
